"""migrate_github_repo_name_from_auth_to_config

Revision ID: 6e39730bc45b
Revises: c60291fb2129
Create Date: 2025-09-28 22:12:53.758477

This migration moves the GitHub repository name from encrypted credentials
to plaintext config_fields on the source_connection table. This change was
made to improve the user experience by making repo_name visible and editable
in the UI without requiring credential re-authentication.

IMPORTANT: This migration requires the ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable
to be set, as it needs to decrypt and re-encrypt credentials.

To run a dry-run first:
